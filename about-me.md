on the internet, i go by the name spicata — the resident plant — who lives somewhere in the continent-country of Australia (between UTC+8 to UTC+10). my friends and i decided it wold be neat to have out own websites, and so we took a dive into the web.

at least here, on the internet, i'm very interested in how people make little communities and about hidden internet technologies. things like [digital](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) [gardening](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) & [decentralised](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/towards-data-neutrality) [systems](https://scuttlebutt.nz/) & [internet](https://nightfall.city/) [communities](https://yesterweb.org/) (lots of them) & [different internet protocols](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) etc. personally, i find the human aspect of the internet so exciting, and how lots of individuals are able to create this stuff.

also, i think art is pretty cool, and i would love to learn about it, if i knew where to start. in the meantime, i just make short/not-short comics strips/slideshows over at [xob](https://xob.99000000.xyz).
