## sub-human

hyde is often seen as almost sub-human or monkeyish in a sense. this may have been because of charle's darwins recent discoveries on the process of evolution, and the idea that humans are animals were not that different, as they came from the same ancestors. this led to the fear that if it were possible for humans to evolve from monkeys, it would also be possible for humans to devolve into monkeys. this fear of giving into our primal urges is a key part of jekyll and hyde, and it acts as the backbone of it's conflict. this novel is about the conflict between humanity and primalism.

hyde can be seen as the "primality" of jekyll. he is brutish, angry, unsocialable, and impulsive. he is not bound by the laws of societies and does so as he wills. this at first is a freeing experience for jekyll, but as time goes on, we come to learn tha tthese social laws are integral to a functioning human being, without them we become a monster.

### satanic

hyde is also often likened to satan, showing him as the pure embodiment of evil that lived with jekyll. this could be referring to how all of us house a little satan within ourselves, and that the primal instincts we feel are the preciptation of this evil. this could be seen in the context of victorian society. During this time, people were "austere", there was a strict social law, and those who went against it were 'evil'.

there was a harsh binary between 'good' and 'evil', and those who did not succumb to their desires would be seen as 'good'. jekyll and hyde challenges this division, saying that they exist in coesxistence.

### id

jekyll and hyde could also be understood from a freudian perspective. freud, the creator of psychoanalysis, was concerned primarily about what he believed was the 'unconscious mind', the belief that a part of us operated in the background without our own realisation. he posited that this unconscious was influenced by all the feelings and desires we had repressed, usually during childhood, and that although these seemed to be forgotten, they would still play a role in our lives and fears from the unconscious.

there was the idea that there were three entities in the human mind, the id, the ego, and the superego. the id was the instictual part of our brain. it wanted to do what it desires away from the bounds of society. the superego on the other hand was the supreme morality, it would adhere only to social laws. the ego was the middle-man, and it was the part that would weigh up both sides and choose. within jekyll and hyde, we can see hyde as the id, a part of jekyll that goes around doing what it pleases with no remorse when he hurts others. in a sense, jekyll can be seen as both the ego and the superego, as he used to act as the controller of his own actions, and once separated, would be the person who would be disgusted by hyde's actions. however, we can comment that the character of 'superergo' is not truly realised in jekyll and hyde, and this is acknolwedged by jekyll, stating that if he were to go into this experiment with nobler goals (separating superego from himself so that it can go around doing good), then the result may have been different.

another key psychoanalytical 'trope' is the idea the, when we dream, the unconscious is finally released, and that our fears and locked away feelings are realised in a dream. we can see this when jekyll often wakes up from dreams as hyde, and where utterson dreams of the mystery of hyde, a very pressing issue that concerns him greatly. jekyll waking up as hyde could be the precipitation of his unconscious desires into its full state, and this finally taking over his life.

## a mirror of victorian society

a key part of victorian society is that it was highly concerned with public image. so much so that they would have essentially different identities for their public life and other one for their private life. this can be vaguely seen with utterson and enfield, whom both have their own desires and feelings, but conceals them to become the model victorian citizen. however, of course, this is most pronounced in jekyll, who goes as far as to create literally a new identity for his private life, using 'jekyll' as merely his public life.

this is almost entirely a reflection of victorian society, whose citizens were so concerned with their status and reputation, which is what causes hyde to be such a compelling villian, as it reflects in inner conflict within the reader. this would be a common theme within gothic literature; the heroes would not be perfect and its villains would reveal the deepest and darkest flaws within humanity.

however, it is the distinction between the public and private life that eventually leads to the death of jekyll, as his treatment of jekyll as a mere shell of his true self leads to his adoption of hyde as his true self, which in turn leads to his demise.

the text also shows a possible one-sided-ness of this private and public life, wherein the private life conceals hidden desires, and this one-sideness comes into play as only hyde, jekyll's evil side, is ever condensed.[^1]

## science

science boomed during the industrial revolution, and of course with that, came skepticism. people were skeptical of the goodwill of science, and this led to a general kind of distrust of science, which we see in jekyll and hyde. enfield not only refers to a doctor as "sawbones", but science is also seen as a destructive tool, and jekyll is seemingly punished for his hubris in trying to alter the "god-designed" human body. the use of science is a common gothic feature, and this distrust in it kind of rings throughout texts during this time, such as in the romantic movement as well.

also, back in victorian society, there was a widely held belief that the your inner self was reflected by a person physical appearance. this was delved into by people who studied criminals, but is also reflect by the fact jekyll quite literally changes in form as he turns to hyde. hyde himself, a culmination of all of jekyll's evil, comes out as revolting, and all other people are disgusted by his mere being.

## challenging whatsit called

jekyll and hyde also challenges the (whatsit called the uh) dichotomy that victorians were so engaged in. dichotomy is the belief that two concepts are completely opposed to each other: it is either this, or it is that. good or bad, pure or evil, man or woman, stuff like that. obviously jekyll and hyde himself as a character challenges this idea, is shows that humans can be both seemingly good and definitely bad at the same time, that there are more than one human inside a human. he is this mix.

utterson is also kind of a mix. he is kind of... let's say stale, however he also has stuff that he enjoys.

## spirituality

victorian society was very religious, but also decreasingly religious. science was becoming bigger. however, we can still see the influence on religion in this text. jekyll, who messed with the god given human body and flaws is obviously punished for doing so, this matter is beyond the human grasp. to add to that, jekyll often mentions how he split his soul, which in purely scientific ideology, is ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ we dunno, maybe it exists, maybe it doesn't. however, the idea of something separate to our body is common enough in religion.

also, the potion literally changes him.

## Story of the Door

- "Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable."

    Juxtaposition of concepts and imagery. "cold, backwards in sentiment, dusty" but "yet somehow lovable". This could show the contrast of public and private lives. Utterson seems a (well... dead on the inside), but he is actually good.
    
    The visual imagery also helps set up the character of Utterson, who is not the perfect protagonist, and yet the audience is positioned to like him.

- "'I incline to Cain's heresy,'" {said by Utterson}

    Cain's heresy here is a biblical allusion to the story of Cain and Abel. This is specifically referring to Cain's dialogue "Am I my brother's keeper?", showing how Utterson would rather stay away and see someone run themselves into the ground than getting involved in it. He really doesn't care. This happened all the way to the case of Jekyll and Hyde, where he broke this rule and got involved, to pretty bad results.

- "It wasn’t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut." {said by Enfield}

    A Juggernaut is a "a huge, powerful, and overwhelming force", seeing as how Hyde simply walked through that girl instead of stopping, unimpeded. It was derived from a [Jagannath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggernaut), which is a diety worshipped in India; Juggernaut itself refers to a vehicle carrying a model of Jagannath.
    
    Also, the diction used, specifically "it" dehumanises Hyde, and likens him to a sort of object or animal.

- "with a kind of black, sneering coolness ... really like Satan" {said by Enfield}

    Likens Hyde to Satan. Yet another biblical reference. The result is clear enough.

- "There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one ... There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor; none below."

    Not entirely sure technique. House is given a sense of mystery. The lack of windows gives the impression of possibly some criminal activity.

## Search for Mr Hyde

- "would have estranged Damon and Pythias" {bL}

- "but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved"

    Draws parallels between Utterson (right now) and Jekyll a while back

- "even in his dreams"

- "'If he be Mr. Hyde,' he had thought, 'I shall be Mr. Seek.'"

    HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

- "God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say?"

    Darwinism

- "he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life"

## Carew Murder Case

- "ape-like fury"

    continuing on.

## Remarkable Incident of Dr Lanyon

- "It is a question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant"

## The Last Night

- "was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat"

    Pathetic fallacy is used here to highlight the incoming calamity of Dr Jekyll, as well as the destruction of Utterson's peace.

- "masked thing like a monkey"

## Henry Jekyll's Full Statement of the Case

- "I concealed my pleasures" {by Jekyll}

    Context: ties in heavily to the Victorian context of concealing your  private life and instead only displaying your public life. Jekyll only showed the good parts of him to society. Also can be tied into the Gothic movement, whose characters would reflect the inner plights of the audience to an extent. The Victorian would seem to be earnest (not really).
    
    Also can be seen as Freudian psychoanalysis. Henry Jekyll is the ego, keeping his superego and his id in check. Hyde is the id, giving into primal desires and acting on impulse, a culmination of all of Jekyll's repressed desires.

- "that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point." {by Jekyll}

    Repetition? Parallelism? I don't know what you call it, but it's obviously drawing a contrast, and could show the idea of conflict between preconceived ideas and new ideas, such as was the case in society during that time, especially with science and stuff.

- "I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature." {by J}

    The smaller Hyde was a part of a larger Jekyll, but also younger and lighter, unburdened by the pestering of the other guy (unlike Jekyll), and his ideas not fully developed.

- "drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture" {bJ}

- "It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty" {bJ}

- "before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals" {bJ}

- "All things therefore seemed to point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse"

- "Jekyll had more than a father’s interest; Hyde had more than a son’s indifference"
