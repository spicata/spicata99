## 小学、初中和高中一共上几年？

In China, students spend 6 years in primary school, 3 years in middle school, and 3 years in senior school. This is different to Australian school, where there is no middle school and no senior school, and instead we spend 6 years in "high school".

## 每天上学和放学的时间？

Everyday in Australia, we start school at 8:50 in the morning. On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursday, we finish school at 3:30 pm, but on Wednesday and Friday, we finish school at 2:32, but my friends and I stay at the library until 3:30. So at its longest, the day lasts for 6 hours and 40 minutes

However, in China, the school day starts at 7:30 and ends at 5:20, but many students stay after school to do even more studying. This means that they spend at least 9 hours and 50 minutes at school, which is 3 hours longer than Australia. But, they do get a 2 hours break from 12:00 to 2:00.

## 每天都上几节课？

Most schools in Australia have 5 classes per day, but our specific school has 6 periods on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.

Meanwhile in China, students attend four or five classes in the morning and two to three in the afternoon. That's a lot :-E.

## 学生在学校都学什么科目？

I study physics, chemistry, specialist, methods, chinese, and literature, however there are a lot of other subjects that you can learn in Australia, such as: applications, biology, human bio, design, visual arts, drama, computer science, music, food tech (sometimes), pols and law, econs, philo, psych, and more.

On the other hand, Chinese students can learn chinese, maths, english, phys, chem, bio, geography, history, music, visual arts, comp sci, technology. Of these, chinese, maths, and english will definitely be tested, but also physical sciences or social sciences will also be tested.
