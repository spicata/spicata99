- relative atomic mass vs mass number?
    - mass number is the same as the nucleon number. relative atomic mass is the actual mass of the isotope, based on a twelfth of c-12.

## [the development of atoms: one](developingAtoms1)

- dates please
- how did the development in technologies contribute to model

## [shells: one](shells1)

- what is the difference between an energy level and a shell?
    - energy level = electron shell
- what is the difference between a sub-shell and an orbital.
    - i had a realisation !!!
- are the shells really 2, 8, 18, 32?
- why are they called sharp, principle, diffuse, and fundamental

## [mass spectrometry: one](massSpec1)

- what is the actual wording of the ionisation step?
- wording for detection step

## [absorption and emission: one](absorptionEmission1)

- how to describe emission spectra?
- spectra vs spectrum?
- what is aes?
- how does it work?
- what are the steps
- remember that potassium = violet
- why is the sample atomised?
- i dont know from there.
