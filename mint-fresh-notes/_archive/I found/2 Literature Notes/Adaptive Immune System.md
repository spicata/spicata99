# Adaptive Immune System

- Dendrites, B-cells, T-cells, and friends
- B and T come from bone marrow
	- B hangs around there.
	- T go to thymus (murder university).
	- Both go live in the lymph nodes.
- B cells (plasma cells) produce antibodies.
	- Binds to antigen to slow, signal, and prevent
		- % Antigens bind to antibodies, causing a response
		- Antibodies also stop poisons, just a bit too slowly.
	- Antibodies have variable Fab regions
		- @ Could target anything
- RAT, PCR (nucleic acid), Serology (antibody), Sequencing
- [12a2a - The Immune Effects of HIV](12a2a%20-%20The%20Immune%20Effects%20of%20HIV.md)md) does a good enough of a job at explaining parts of the immune system.
- B-cells turn into plasma cells and memory B-cells.
	- Store of memory cells allows for faster response
- Antibody can bind to viral binding sites
	- Stops pathogens from entering cells
		- Neutralisation
- Antibody binds to antigen
	- Just marking
		- Opsonisation
