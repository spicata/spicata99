# Alpha Decay #Literature 
- Radioactive decay is a process that atoms undergo to become more stable, by releasing energy/particles
- Alpha decay releases alpha particles ($\alpha$ particles), which are identical to a helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons)
- It is extremely slow, short-reaching, and not penetrative, however, it is extremely ionising.
- If an alpha-emitter comes into contact with cells (such as eating, breathing, or injecting), it can cause lasting cellular damage.
