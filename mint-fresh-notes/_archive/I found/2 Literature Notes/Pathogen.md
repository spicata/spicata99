# Pathogens

- Organisms that cause diseases
	- Viruses*, bacteria, fungi, and more
- Some of these pathogens only do this as a side hustle (facultative), whilst others live on this (obligate)
	- Some inhabit different places as well (human (definitive) and mosquito (intermediate, vector) in malaria)
- The more obligate ones can make you suffer without dying, the better.
- Viruses are more specific due to their requirements
	- Bacteriophage
- Pathogens are bad, but our immune system is even worse
- 4 major types: Virus, Bacteria, Fungi, Protists

| Criterion | Bacteria | Virus | Fungi | Protists |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Alive | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| …troph | Heterotroph | Autotroph | Heterotroph | Either |
| …karyotic | Prokaryotic | - | Eukaryotic | Eukaryotic | 
| …cellular | Single-cellular | - | Either | Either | 
| …scopic | Microscopic* | Microscopic | Either | Either |
| Size | 0.1 to 5 um | 20 to 300 nm | ? | ? |
| Cell Wall | Phospholipid Bilayer | - | Phospholipid Bilayer | ? |
