# Beta Decay #Literature 
- Also to achieve stability
- Beta ($\beta$) decay is when neutrons transform into a positron or a negatron (electron).
- As they are small, it can be ejected from the nucleus extremely quickly, and it has a moderate penetrative power, but has less ionising ability.
	- It can penetrate more as it can fit through the gaps between molecules better than alpha particles. It has less ionising ability as it needs to be closer due to its smaller (negative) charge.
- $^A_{Z}X\to^A_{Z+1}Y+^0_{-1}\beta$
- Comes with gamma often
- e.g. bismuth-214
## Unlimited
- Positron actually are anti-electrons
- Positive decay means that a proton turns into a neutron and releases positron + neutrino
	- $^A_{Z}X\to^A_{Z-1}Y+^0_{+1}\beta+^0_{0}\nu$
- Negative decay means that a neutron turns into a proton and releases electron + antineutrino (commoner)
	- $^A_{Z}X\to^A_{Z+1}Y+^0_{-1}\beta+^0_{0}\overline{\nu}$
- Electron capture means that a proton eats an electron from (usually) the inner electron shell and becoming a neutron, releasing a neutrino.
	- $^A_{Z}X+^0_{-1}e\to^A_{Z-1}Y+^0_{0}\nu$
