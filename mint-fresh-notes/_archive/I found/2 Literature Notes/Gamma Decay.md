# Gamma Decay
- Gamma ($\gamma$) decay is a form of decay that makes atoms unexcited.
- Releases a photon (gamma ray)
- $^{ Am }_{Z}X\to^{ A }_{Z}X+^{ 0 }_{0}\gamma$
- Accompanies other types of decay
- Essentially the same as X-Rays, except that X-rays originate from the electron cloud and gamma rays from the nucleus.
