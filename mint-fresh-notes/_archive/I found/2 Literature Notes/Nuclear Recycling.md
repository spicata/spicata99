# Nuclear Recycling #Literature 
- Uranium-235 is fuel, but it comes mixed with uranium-238 which is more common.
	- Uranium-235 is the only natural isotope capable of undergoing the nuclear fission chain reaction
- Uranium-238 is useless and (almost) stable, however, by adding a neutron, it can become uranium-239 (U-239) —$\beta$→ neptunium-239 (Np-239) —$\beta$→ plutonium-239 (Pu-239)
- If only one-way then nuclear bad, however, if recycled, then good.
