# HIV Enzymes

- Protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase
	- Protease breaks apart the polyproteins
		- HIV-1 protease allows immature HIV to become mature HIV
		- Polyprotein cleaving
		- Often targeted to mess up HIV
	- Reverse transcriptase turns RNA into DNA
		- This is very rare, and also not good at its job.
		- It is incredibly efficient, consisting of two of the same proteins, just that one is clipped.
	- Integrase integrates the new DNA into our body
		- 4 of them combine, and attach the ends of viral DNA into our DNA, cutting it and entering.
