# Iron Stability

- Iron-56 is one of the most stable nuclei
- It has the lowest mass per nucleon, but lower binding energy compared to nickel-62.
	- Nickel has more neutrons, and thus is still heavier.
- In stars, nickel-56 is formed (not Ni-58), and this decays into Fe-56
- I guess. it just is stable
- This stability makes it the third most stable
- Most fusion and fission reaction tends towards Fe-56
