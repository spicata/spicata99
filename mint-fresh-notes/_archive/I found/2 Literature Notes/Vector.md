# Vector

## (The Printing Connection, 2011)

- Mathematical formulae used to make curves and basic, rudimentary shapes
- Best for designs
	- Not so great for photographs and such
- Tends to be smaller than raster graphics
	- Not only that but scalable

## (Dvornechuck, 2022)

- Vector graphic is preferred in web-design, such as:
	- Fonts,
	- Logos, 
	- Graphics
- Simply more accurate
- .pdf, .svg
