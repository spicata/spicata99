# Maslow's Hierarchy

![Maslows-Heirarchy](../../../assets/Maslows-Heirarchy.png)

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (depicted above) is a diagram by Abraham Maslow depicting 5 tiers of human needs (sometimes containing 8 tiers), where each subsequent tier requiring the ones below it to be achieved before being able to be achieved itself. From bottom to top, the tiers are:

1. **Physiological needs** which are requirements for basic survival, such as water, food, and shelter;
2. **Safety needs**, things that protect an individual from harm, including security, employment, and health;
3. **Love and belonging** which are social needs, such as friendship, intimacy, and family;
4. **Esteem needs** which are further split into;
	1. *Esteem for one's self:* dignity and mastery; and
	2. *Desire for respect:* status and prestige; and finally
5. **The need for Self-actualisation**, the desire to become the most one can be.

These goals are split into deficiency needs and growth needs. A deficiency need is a need that arises due to deprivation and the incentive to meet these needs lessen as they are more achieved, but increasing the longer it isn't met. 

For example, a person who has not eaten food in a while will feel very hungry, but as they eat more, they begin to feel less hungry; the incentive to continue to accomplish the goal diminishes. 
These needs include:
- Physiological needs,
- Safety needs,
- Love and belonging, and
- Esteem

Growth needs, on the other hand, are needs which increase the more they are fulfilled. The growth needs are:
- Self-actualisation

Maslow believed that humans had the innate desire to achieve self-actualisation, but to achieve them, they need to satiate their more basic needs first. He explains that: "what a man can be, he must be," referring to how humans have a tendency to become self-aware.
Similarly, Socrates believed in the betterment and completion of life through philosophy. Quoted with saying "the unexamined life in not worth living", he shows his belief that achieving self-actualisation and awareness is paramount in human life; an idea that he encouraged towards his fellow Athenians.

Having observed how humans tended to follow others and the majority rather than think for themselves, even without logical reasoning, Socrates believed that thinking logically for themselves would benefit humanity. This prompted him to question everything.
Maslow's differentiation between deficiency and growth needs support Socrates' observations; creating a well where people can live comfortably without any incentive to change, where they can follow others without achieving self-actualisation.
As well as this, Maslow believed that everyone's "self-actualisation" would be different: achieved in different ways and appearing in different forms; and thus can only be achieved by the individual, similar to the ideas of Socrates' belief on individualism.
