# HIV Spike Glycoproteins

- gp41 and gp120 bind to CD4, which infects CD4 cells
	- CD4+ Helper T cells are responsible for activating the CD8 Killer T cells
	- By binding, it will draw the virus and the cell close enough to merge.
		- HIV’s lipid bilayer envelope is the same as humans’.
		- gp120 may change shape to bind to more than one receptor.
	- The two proteins are formed when gp160 is cleaved.
- These spike proteins are covered in carbohydrates, which prevents antibodies from being able to detect (and bind to) HIV
	- This is massively advantageous.
	- Harder to research
- Parts of the gp120 proteins are variable, making it hard to mount an immune response
