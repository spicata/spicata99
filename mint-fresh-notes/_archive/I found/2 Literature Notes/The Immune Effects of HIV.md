# The Immune Effects of HIV

- HIV’s gp120 targets CD4 receptors; found on the (CD4+) Helper T cells
	- Infected Helper T cells are ordered to do programmed cell death
		- Reduction of Helper T cell count in our body
	- ! CD4 exists to allow MHC II binding
- Helper T cells help activate B cells and (CD8) Killer T cells
	- Also help ~~B cells~~ plasma cells know what type of antibody to produce
	- These two are paramount to immune response
