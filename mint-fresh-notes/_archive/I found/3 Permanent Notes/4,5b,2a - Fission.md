# 4,5b,2a - Fission

Fission is a form of radioactive decay where a large and unstable atom splits into smaller atoms, known as a fission product. Fission can happen spontaneously, or it may require a stimulus, such as a neutron in the case of Uranium-235. Fission occurs when the daughter atoms will have a higher binding energy than the parent atom, as this will allow it to become more stable. Due to this, it always tends towards iron-56.

With fission, chain reactions are possible, which act as the basis of how nuclear power works ([8 - How a Nuclear Reactor Works](8%20-%20How%20a%20Nuclear%20Reactor%20Works.md)md)md)).
