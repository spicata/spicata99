# 4,5b,a - Iron Stability

Iron-56 is one of the most stable nuclei in the world (third highest binding energy, only beaten by Fe-58 and Ni-62). Strangely, this extremely stable nucleus is not *magical* ([4,5c - Magic Numbers & Helium Stability](4,5c%20-%20Magic%20Numbers%20&%20Helium%20Stability.md)md)md)), it just is that stable. However, due to the slight weight difference between neutrons and protons ($m_{N}=m_{Z}+0.00138$), it has the lowest mass per nucleon of all nuclides. Despite being less stable than Ni-62, Fe-56 is still formed within star’s cores, as Ni-56 is more commonly formed, which beta decays in Fe-56. Most fusion and fission reactions tends towards Fe-56 due it is surprisingly high stability.
