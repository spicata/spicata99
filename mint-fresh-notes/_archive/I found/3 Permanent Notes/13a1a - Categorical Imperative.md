# 13a1a - Categorical Imperative

Hypothetical notes are the paths to certain ends ([[13a1b - Ends]]), while categorical imperatives are the path to any of them. Only one such exists: act as if your principle creates universal law. Contradiction arise, for example
1. You can’t accept but leave a promise unfulfilled, as if applied universally, there would be not promises made, thus contradicting the scenario that allowed this to arise.
2. You shouldn’t believe that people should not receive help, as if applied universally, what happens when you want help?

To pass contradiction, we need strictness; to pass unwillingness, we need leniency. People aren’t means, as if applied universally, you would be used as a need, thus no rational person would will that.
