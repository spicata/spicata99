Mass defect is the difference between the actual weight of an atom and the weight of its constituents. It is often denoted as $\Delta M=(Zm_{p}+Nm_{n})-M_{A}$. This difference is accounted by the binding energy of an atom, which is the energy required to break apart an atom back into its constituents. 

Some notable atoms are the helium-4, carbon-12, and iron-56 ([4,5c - Magic Numbers & Helium Stability](4,5c%20-%20Magic%20Numbers%20&%20Helium%20Stability.md)). Helium-4 has a strangely high binding energy, which is surpassed next by carbon-12. Iron-56 is the most stable nucleus, thus all fission ([4,5b,2a - Fission](4,5b,2a%20-%20Fission.md)) and fusion[^1] tends towards iron-56, as in a star’s core.

This binding energy can be calculated by $E=mc^{2}$, where $c=2.9979\times 10^{8}\text{m/s}$. Energy is also measured in joules and mass in kilograms ([4,5a - The Helium Nucleus](4,5a%20-%20The%20Helium%20Nucleus.md))
