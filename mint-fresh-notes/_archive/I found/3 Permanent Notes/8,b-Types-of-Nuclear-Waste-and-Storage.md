# 8,b - Types of Nuclear Waste and Storage #Permanent 
Nuclear waste is split up into three categories: low-level, intermediate-level, and high-level waste. Low-level waste is by far the most common form of nuclear waste, accounting for approximately 90% of the total volume of nuclear waste. This includes items that have been lightly contaminated by radiation, such as the tools that are used in a nuclear reactor. Low-level waste is relatively easy to dispose of, being compacted and stored in short-term storage, then disposed of as regular waste.

Intermediate and high-level wastes are more dangerous and difficult to store, however, they are recyclable in most cases[^1], which is employed by most countries. However, select countries have opted to store them in nuclear waste facilities (named repositories)[^2], such as Finland.
