# 12,a - HIV and AIDS

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that targets and weakens the human immune system; currently, 38.4 million people have HIV ([12a3a - At Risk for HIV](12a3a%20-%20At%20Risk%20for%20HIV.md)md)).

| Demographic | Count        |
|:------------|:-------------|
| All         | 38.4 million |
| Adult       | 36.7 million |
| Female      | 19.7 million |
| Male        | 16.9 million |
| Children    |  1.7 million |  

## How HIV works

HI[12,a,a - HIV Structure](12,a,a%20-%20HIV%20Structure.md)re.md)) is a retrovirus (a family of viruses that encode their genetic material as RNA), that can be transmitted through bodily fluids such as blood, semen, and vaginal fluids; common routes of transmission are through the use of unclean syringes - for either illicit drugs or in hospital - and sexual intercourse. 

HIV infects the human immune system, specifically helper T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells; all essential parts to the correct functioning of this sy[12a2a - The Immune Effects of HIV](12a2a%20-%20The%20Immune%20Effects%20of%20HIV.md)20HIV.md)). On top of that, HIV embeds itself within the lymphatic system, particularly the lymph nodes, where it may stay dormant (latent) for several years. In response to this infection, the body will often command these infected immune cells to undergo apoptosis (a way to “dispose” of cells safely). 

As more of these helper T and other immune cells are killed, the immune system becomes increasingly weakened, which allows for opportunistic pathogens to take hold in the body, and it sometimes leads to the development of cancer cells in the body.

## Symptoms

HIV is broken into 3 different phases: acute HIV, clinical latency (AKA chronic HIV), and symptomatic HIV. The acute HIV phase are indicated by the very first symptoms of HIV and occur shortly after the infection. Its symptoms include:
- A fever,
- Headache,
- A sore throat,
- Diarrhea,
- Weight loss, and
- Coughing.

These symptoms are similar to cold symptoms, and often so mild that people do not notice it, thus making it difficult to diagnose. Despite this, the viral load within the bloodstream is the high during this phase, allowing for the transmission of HIV. This is then proceeded by clinical latency: when HIV lays dormant for several years. This is accompanied by no symptoms. Finally, there is symptomatic HIV, which is the stage when the more severe symptoms appear, such as:
- Fever,
- Swollen lymph nodes,
- Pneumonia, and
- Shingles

Those with HIV are also more prone to getting sick. Eventually, if left untreated this can develop into autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

## Treatment

Sadly, HIV cannot be cured, but luckily, it can be suppressed. It is difficult to cure HIV as it remains embedded in the lymph nodes, where they can replicate and re-enter the bloodstream. Using medications, we are able to kill all the HIV in the bloodstream, but without continual consumption of this drug, HIV return back into the bloodstream.

A way to supress HIV is through antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the viral load within the bloodstream under a detectable amount, which will allow safe sex between a person with and a person without HIV[12,b - HIV Support Groups](12,b%20-%20HIV%20Support%20Groups.md)20Groups.md)

## Prevention

As with many other STIs, the proper usage of protection can be used to mostly protect against HIV. The use of male and female condoms has been found to cut down the chances of getting HIV by a substantial amount. On top of that, the aforementioned ART can also protect others from getting HIV. When the proper HIV treatment (including ART) is used by pregnant women, the probability that the infant also has HIV can be reduced to less than 1%. 

Several governments have also created programs that hands out clean needles to both hospital and drug users to curb the number of HIV cases caused by reusing the same needle on several people.
