# 13b - Goodwill and Duty

To act from duty is to act according to the moral law. This can be tested through categorical imperatives ([[13a - Categorical Imperative]]); if applied universally without contradicting and with will, it is moral. People can act with duty or from duty. Those who act with duty do it for an extrinsic benefit; those who act from duty do it even through difficulty; this is goodwill ([[13c - Goodwill in Dreamtime stories]]).
