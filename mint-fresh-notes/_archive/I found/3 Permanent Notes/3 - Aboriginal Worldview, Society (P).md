# 3 - Aboriginal Worldview, Society #Permanent 
Aboriginal society is founded on the idea of kinship clans, where everyone has a responsibility to their clan, which is enforced by the Law. ([3,a - The Law](3,a%20-%20The%20Law.md)md))

The Aboriginal society is incredibly spiritualistic. If such a disconnect (between society and spirituality) present in the Western world were to exist in Aboriginal society, it would lead to the loss of identity and societal ruin[^1]. However, unlike Western society, spirituality is completely separate from ideology[^2]. Ideology arises when there is a “true way”[^3], which can act as a dividing part in spirituality, as evidenced by the breakup of Christianity into many branches due to a conflict on how one achieves heaven. The Aboriginal spirituality does not contain this “true way”[^4].

Aboriginal society is a deeply altruistic one[^5], where it is commonplace for people to distribute excess things, instead of keeping it for personal gain[^6]. For example, if plenty of fish is caught during a fishing trip, they would distribute it to the community for free, instead of keeping it. It is posited that altruism may be a more developed idea than possession.

[^1]: **Elaborate**: Why would that happen?
[^2]: Is this a reason why spirituality has become more minor in modern society? Does the manipulation of spirituality through ideology shake the faith in it?
[^3]: What is a “true way”? Would it be the certain way to approach a religion or to achieve the goals of the religion?
[^4]: **Elaborate**. What does it mean not to have this “true way”?
[^5]: How did an altruistic society such as this one arise? Would it not be beneficial under most circumstances to be selfish?
[^6]: Primary source would be seeing Aboriginal dances and seeing them distribute things during that dance.
