# 4,b - Strong Nuclear Force

The strong nuclear force is the strongest of the four fundamental forces in physics. It not only holds the nuclei together, but also the quarks, that make up the protons and neutrons. These quarks are fundamental particles (fermions) that compose hadrons; coming in various different colours and flavours. 

These are bound together by gluons (boson), that are particles that transmit forces; in this case, strong nuclear force, primarily holding quarks together. These gluons are incredibly strong, however, they have a limited range. However, some of this (residual) force happens outside of the nucleons ([4,c - Pions](4,c%20-%20Pions.md)md)md)), which is what keeps nuclei together. Too many protons mean that the electromagnetic forces take over, as the repelling force overwhelms strong nuclear force (How about the oppo[4,b,a - Neutron's Instability](4,b,a%20-%20Neutron's%20Instability.md)ty.[4,a - Why does it release alpha particles](4,a%20-%20Why%20does%20it%20release%20alpha%20particles.md)icles.md)icles)
