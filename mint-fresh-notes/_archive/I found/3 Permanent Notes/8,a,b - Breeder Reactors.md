# 8,a,b - Breeder Reactors #Permanent 
Breeder reactors are special nuclear reactors that can produce more fissile material than is put into the system. They can be likened to a standard nuclear reactor that has an inbuilt recycling system. Breeder reactors allow infertile material to become fertile, by hitting it with a neutron, making them unstable, which allows these reactors to utilise more of the energy in nuclear fuel; this makes them more efficient, but not quite renewable.

The reason that conventional reactors (using uranium-235) cannot do this is because the neutrons do not fly at a fast enough speed to transform uranium-238 to uranium-239. Thus, for breeder reactors that use uranium, they need to be fast reactors, meaning that the neutrons fly at a much higher speed than in a normal reactor.

However, this is still experimental technology, as it has not been developed due to fear that it would make nuclear weapons more accessible, as it will make the radioactive uranium-235 much more abundant.
