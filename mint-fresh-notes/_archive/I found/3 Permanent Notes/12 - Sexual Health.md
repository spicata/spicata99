# 12 - Sexual Health

Sexual health education is an incredibly important subject that needs to be taught at all stages of education. It raises awareness of many health issues, such as the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in society, and leads to safer sexual behaviour. 

One clear example of the effect of sexual health education would be the downwards trend of teenage pregnancy in Australia; between 1971 and 2020, there has been a 86% decrease in births from 15 to 19 year olds (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021; Linda Mann et al., 2020). However, communities that have not yet or are unable to receive such education, such as Indigenous Australians and Torres Strait Islanders or those who are economically disadvantaged tend to have a higher teenage fertility rate than the rest of Australia.

To add to the importance of this topic, educating teenagers reduces the number of risky sexual decisions that they take; educated teenagers tend to have less sexual partners and use protection more often that those who have not received such education (CDC, 2021). This can mitigate the spread of STIs in our communities ([12,a - HIV and AIDS](12,a%20-%20HIV%20and%20AIDS.md)md)), which still remains a large problem within developed countries, where almost half of the STI cases happen to be teenagers (Advocates for Youth, 2021).
