# 12,a,b - HIV Spike Glycoproteins

Two spike glycoproteins are present on the envelope of an HIV virion: gp41 and gp120. gp120 binds to the CD4 receptors found on CD4+ Helper T cells, as well as some other immune cells. These CD4+ Helper T cells are responsible for activating the CD8 Killer T cells ([12a2a - The Immune Effects of HIV](12a2a%20-%20The%20Immune%20Effects%20of%20HIV.md)md)). By binding to these receptors, the spike proteins can draw the virus’ envelope and the cell’s membrane close enough to merge. gp41 mediates this merge. To bind better, gp120 has the ability to change shape in order to bind with a second receptor.

These spike proteins are formed when gp160 is cleave[12,a,a,a - HIV Enzymes](12,a,a,a%20-%20HIV%20Enzymes.md)es.md)). They are also covered in carbohydrates, which prevents antibodies from being able to detect and bind to HIV, which is massively advantageous as it makes mounting an immune response more difficult and also more hard to research.
