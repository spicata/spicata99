# 4,5c - Magic Numbers & Helium Stability

Much like electron, nucleons are also organised in shells, which, when filled, lead to a more stable nucleus (like a noble gas). There exists two types of these **nuclear shells**, one for protons and one for neutrons. These shells can contain different numbers of nucleons, which are *“magic number”* (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126).

Magic numbers are responsible for the incredible stability of certain nuclides. A nucleus with either the proton or neutron count as one of these numbers is **magic**, and thus are more stable than their counterparts. However, if both the counts are of a magic number, then the nucleus is **doubly magic**, as is the case with Calcium-40 and Helium-4. This is one of the reasons why Helium-4 has such an incredibly high stability (it is also a noble gas making in chemically inert). However, stable nuclei are not always magical ([4,5b,a - Iron Stability](4,5b,a%20-%20Iron%20Stability.md)md)md)).

An interesting proposition that arises due to these magic numbers is the possibility of heavy (post-uranium) elements being stabl[4,5b - Binding Energy and Mass Defect](4,5b%20-%20Binding%20Energy%20and%20Mass%20Defect.md)ct.md)ct)
