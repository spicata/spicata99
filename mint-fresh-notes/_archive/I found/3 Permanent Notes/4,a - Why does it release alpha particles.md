# 4,a - Why does it release alpha particles
 
 As nuclei become larger and larger, the residual strong nuclear force ([[4,b - Strong Nuclear Force]]) between the nucleons are overcome by electromagnetic forces[^1] which causes the nucleus to become unstable. To make the nucleus more stable, the atom releases these $\alpha$ particles so that it can shorten the distances between protons in an attempt to become more st[4,5a - The Helium Nucleus](4,5a%20-%20The%20Helium%20Nucleus.md)us.[4 - Alpha Decay](4%20-%20Alpha%20Decay.md)Decay.md)Decay)
