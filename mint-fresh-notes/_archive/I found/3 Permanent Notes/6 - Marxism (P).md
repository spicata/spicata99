# 6 - Marxism #Permanent 
*The Communist Manifesto* and other of Marx’s literary works cannot be boiled down into just a philosophy. Rather it is a critique of said philosophy, but instead of discrediting it, it reinforces it by positing that it should be worked upon to be put into reality rather than stay thoughts in our head. Unlike other philosophers, he would consider each aspect of human nature in relation to each other and would treat them dynamically rather than using abstractions.

Marx posited that, paradoxically, the more output the worker produces, the more impoverished that the worker becomes, as his output in not his to have under the capitalist system, rather feeding the bourgeoise, alienating the worker from his work. This is problematic, as humans are inherently creative and productive being; capitalism is just a system that abuses that.

Another question that Marx asks is: if humans produce more than what is needed to sustain themselves, where does the rest go? Marx beckons that this excess produces is not only goes to the bourgeoise, but also unnecessary; it does both harm to the environment and people, only to support the economy.

There were two types of revolutions that Marx believed were possible: a violet one, or a permanent one. In a permanent revolution is a form of revolution where a secondary government is formed by the proletariats, for the proletariats, until all the power eventually comes into the hands of them.
