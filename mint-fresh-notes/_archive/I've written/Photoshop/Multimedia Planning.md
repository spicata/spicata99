# Multimedia Planning

![](../../../assets/Multimedia%20rough%20plan.png)

- Down the middle there will be a tear line. 
	- Use **clipping mask** for textures, add paper
	- Use **adjustment layers** to make it look right
	- Use **warp tool** to add some variety
- On the left (smaller) side, it will be illustrated. 
	- I think **size 3 pen** for outline will be good.
		- Doesn’t have to be straight
	- Try simplified colours to save time and to give it the stylised look. 
		- Make it look like an illustration
- On the right side, apply some filters and use adjustment layers.
	- Using **adjustment layers**, do the following:
		- Increase saturation and vibrancy
		- Change hues
- Make it look like it is half illustrated and half real

~~Put text on the “real” side, using maybe Garamond. Format it as a form of advertisement.~~
