# How I make notes

> [!IMPORTANT] See also

## Structure

I (mainly) use three different types of notes: fleeting notes, literature notes, and permanent notes. Fleeting notes are to capture sudden ideas and things I must not forget. I use literature notes to note down the ideas I find during research and many interesting facts. Permanent notes are the synthesisation and the elaboration on top of these literature notes, dealing with a higher level of thinking and asking questions on top of them.

### Fleeting

Most of my fleeting notes consists of interesting concepts that I may explore later, and also class notes that seem relevant so that I am aware of what to write later. These notes have a short expiry date, and thus it is essential to tackle whatever is in these as quickly as possible. Once their usefulness as run out, they are deleted. Fleeting notes must be kept to a minimum.

### Literature

Literature notes is used to record my research. They are often just a bullet point list ([[Alpha Decay (L)]]). Although they should preferably be short and contain the most amount of information as possible, I struggle with this. They should also have a bibliography.

### Permanent

These are the crux of my notes, and is what everyone sees. Permanent notes are not only an opportunity to test your knowledge, but also a time to be able to link the concepts found in your particular note with other notes that are in your vault. When introducing new terms, try to explain in layman’s terms, then define the term. Permanent notes benefit from having many links.

I also use permanent notes as a space to ask questions. Once I have written the note, I step back and see if what I have written makes sense, and also questions gaps of knowledge and other points that I find interesting. Questions like: “Why does alpha decay specifically produce a helium nucleus” ([[4,5a - The Helium Nucleus]]). These questions become topics of future research, which not only make it easier to understand a topic, but also make it easier to memorise.

It is difficult to memorise that an artery has thicker walls and a vein has valves, but it becomes easier if you remember that the heart pumps blood into the artery. Oh! It must have thicker walls due to having pressure and strain. Oh! A vein must have valves to stop blood from flowing back because it has a lower pressure.

## The Process

I tend to take fleeting notes at school. Sure, they teach some valuable information, but teacher lack the time to teach their subject thoroughly, and much of the information is borrowed from past years. On top of that, there is not enough time for explanations. Why does that occur? How does this work? What you learn at school can be valuable, but best used as a tool to orient yourselves in the confusing realms of research.

Once you have time, you research upon these subjects. You answer your questions, you find more relevant information. This is the time to develop your understanding of the topic. Oh, the sickness caused from radiation is called acute radiation syndrome. Oh, strong force is transmit by gluons. This is where I use literature notes.

Finally, you write permanent notes. Link these to already existing notes. You not only test your knowledge, but you also but these notes in the context of other notes. Why learn something, if you don’t know where it is used, and what it really does? On top of that, you can’t cheat yourself in writing. When you speak, you may go “you know what I mean”. This, although often ignored in speech, is very clear in writing, and you must always presume that they do not know what you mean, and often that you do not either.
