# 4 - Alpha Decay
Radioactive decay is the process that atoms undergo to become more stable by releasing energy or particles (4,4a - After Decay (P)

![](../../../assets/Alpha-Particle.png)

Alpha decay is extremely slow, short-reaching, and not penetrative (4,3a - Why larger particles are less penetrative (P).

Type of Decay | General Formula (A is atomic Mass, Z is atomic number)
--- | ---
Alpha Decay | $^{A}_{Z}X\to^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y+^{4}_{2}\alpha$

# 4,2a,2a - Gamma Decay 
Gamma ($\gamma$) decay is yet another form of radioactive decay. However, unlike the other forms of decay, $\gamma$ decay occur not because it a nuclear is unstable, as even stable nuclei can undergo $\gamma$ decay. Rather, $\gamma$ decay makes an atom unexcited (4,2a,2b - Excited Atoms.

It is denoted in the form $^{ Am }_{Z}X\to^{ A }_{Z}X+^{ 0 }_{0}\gamma$. Note that $^{ Am }$ indicates that the atom is excited, and that the parent nucleus does not change. Gamma decay often accompanies other types of decay.

When compared to X-rays, it is essentially the same, except that X-rays originate from the electron cloud and gamma rays from the nucleus.

# 4,2a - Beta Decay 
Beta decay is another way that unstable nuclei can achieve stability (4,2a,a - Beta or Alpha decay, increasing stability by increasing the proton to neutron ratio. The electron is tiny, and so it can be ejected from the nucleus as an incredibly high speed[^1]. This is the $\beta$ particle.

Beta decay has higher penetration, as the smaller particle allows it to fit through more gaps in a surface than the $\alpha$ particle. However, it has a lower ionisation ability as it needs to not only be closer due its size, but also because it has a weaker charge.

Alpha Decay | $^A_{Z}X\to^A_{Z+1}Y+^0_{-1}\beta$

It often appears with gamma radiation (4,2a,2a - Gamma Decay. A prime example of beta decaying substance would be bismuth-214.

[^1]: As the amount of protons in a nuclei increases, does the “ejection speed” also increase?

# 4,2a,a - Beta or Alpha decay

>$\beta^-$, $\beta^+$, and $\alpha$ decay are all things that atoms undergo to become more stable, however, why? Why do some atoms undergo $\beta^-$ and others $\alpha$ decay?

![Type of Decay graph](../../../assets/Type%20of%20Decay%20graph.png)

In the above graph, the line of black squares indicates stable atoms, and it acts as a divider between $\beta^-$ and $\beta^+$/$\alpha$ decay. $\beta^-$ decay always occurs to the left of the stability line, as the conversion of a neutron to a proton will move the nucleus right-down on the graph. This will mean that the nuclei will only become more stable if it was already on the left of the stability line. The opposite is true for $\beta^+$ decay. 

As for $\alpha$ decay, as it will lead to the loss of both two neutrons and two protons, and thus will move parallel (towards the origin) to the N=Z line. This means that it will only become more stable when it is on the right of stability line.

# 4,2a,2b - Excited Atoms

A ground state (for an atom) is the state containing the lowest possible energy, hence being the most stable formation. An excited state is a state where an atom contains more energy that this ground state. This usually entails that there are electrons that occupy a higher electron orbital, meaning that there is excess energy within the system of the atom. The electron will release this energy in the form of a X-ray.

A similar principle can be applied to the nucleons within a nucleus. Protons and neutrons can occupy a higher energy **nuclear shell**, and when returning to its ground state, it will release a gamma ray.

# 4,3a - Why larger particles are less penetrative
$\alpha$ particles are significantly larger than $\beta$ particles and $\gamma$ rays, but also has significantly less penetration. However, this (may) seem counter-intuitive. A wrecking ball can more easily break through a wall than a bullet, and still have more energy left over. However, this is not what penetration is.

Penetration is the ability for a particle to *pass through* a substance, not the ability to *break through*[^1]. In this regard, a smaller particle will have an easier time “navigating” its way through a substance, and thus will be able to pass through more easily, whilst an $\alpha$ particle will have a harder time doing so, as it will get caught up in that substance.

# 4,2b - Beta Decay Unlimited
> Everything here on out is extension.

Throw everything you know about positrons and beta decay out, because it is all wrong[^1]. Positrons are actually positively charged electrons, an “anti-electron”. Beta decay is a simplification, and does not make a positron and an electron.

There exists three different modes of beta decay: positive beta decay ($\beta^+$), negative beta decay ($\beta^-$), and electron capture. Negative beta decay is the most common of these, and is the one in 4,2a - Beta Decay (P). It occurs when a neutron transforms into a proton, releasing an electron and an anti-neutrino[^2], with the general formula of: $^A_{Z}X\to^A_{Z+1}Y+^0_{-1}\beta+^0_{0}\overline{\nu}$.

Positive decay is when a proton transforms into a neutron[^3] and releases a positron and a neutrino, coming in the general formula: $^A_{Z}X\to^A_{Z-1}Y+^0_{+1}\beta+^0_{0}\nu$. Electron capture is also when a proton transforms into a neutron, however, it consumes one of the electrons in the inner (K) electron shell, only releasing a neutrino. It’s general formula is: $^A_{Z}X+^0_{-1}e\to^A_{Z-1}Y+^0_{0}\nu$ 

# 4,4a - After Decay
An atom undergoes decay to become more stable, however, even after the decay, the atom may still remain unstable. In this case, it will continue to undergo more decay. This is the case of Uranium-238, which $\alpha$ decays into Thorium-234, which $\beta$ decays into Protactinium-234.

# 4,3b - Why more ionising particles are less penetrative

To add to the limitation that size plays on a the penetration of a particle, the ionisation plays a further role. A particle that ionises and interacts with matter more frequently also loses more energy than one that ionises less, and thus more ionising particles are less penetrative and vice versa.

# 4,5b - Binding Energy and Mass Defect

Mass defect is the difference between the actual weight of an atom and the weight of its constituents. It is often denoted as $\Delta M=(Zm_{p}+Nm_{n})-M_{A}$. This difference is accounted by the binding energy of an atom, which is the energy required to break apart an atom back into its constituents. 

Some notable atoms are the helium-4, carbon-12, and iron-56 (4,5c - Magic Numbers & Helium Stability. Helium-4 has a strangely high binding energy, which is surpassed next by carbon-12. Iron-56 is the most stable nucleus, thus all fission and fusion[^1] tends towards iron-56, as in a star’s core[^2].

!Binding-Energy

This binding energy can be calculated by $E=mc^{2}$, where $c=2.9979\times 10^{8}\text{m/s}$. Energy is also measured in joules and mass in kilograms.

« 4,5a - The Helium Nucleus

# 4,5a - The Helium Nucleus
Alpha decay is the most common form of cluster decay, a type of decay where a nucleus splits into two or more smaller clusters of neutrons and protons[^1]. Its frequency is a result of the special properties of the helium nucleus. The helium nucleus is extremely stable and has a incredibly high binding energy (4,5b - Binding Energy and Mass Defect[^2]. 

!Binding-Energy

On top of that, the protons and neutrons inherently form pseudo-helium nuclei inside of another nucleus[^3], and thus, when decaying, split off a helium nucleus.

« 4 - Alpha Decay

# 4,5c - Magic Numbers & Helium Stability

Much like electron, nucleons are also organised in shells, which, when filled, lead to a more stable nucleus (like a noble gas). There exists two types of these **nuclear shells**, one for protons and one for neutrons. These shells can contain different numbers of nucleons, which are *“magic number”* (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126).

Magic numbers are responsible for the incredible stability of certain nuclides. A nucleus with either the proton or neutron count as one of these numbers is **magic**, and thus are more stable than their counterparts. However, if both the counts are of a magic number, then the nucleus is **doubly magic**, as is the case with Calcium-40 and Helium-4. This is one of the reasons why Helium-4 has such an incredibly high stability (it is also a noble gas making in chemically inert). However, stable nuclei are not always magical ().

An interesting proposition that arises due to these magic numbers is the possibility of heavy (post-uranium) elements being stable.

« 4,5b - Binding Energy and Mass Defect

# 4,5b,a - Iron Stability

Iron-56 is one of the most stable nuclei in the world (third highest binding energy, only beaten by Fe-58 and Ni-62). Strangely, this extremely stable nucleus is not *magical* (4,5c - Magic Numbers & Helium Stability, it has the lowest mass per nucleon of all nuclides. Despite being less stable than Ni-62, Fe-56 is still formed within star’s cores, as Ni-56 is more commonly formed, which beta decays in Fe-56. Most fusion and fission reactions tends towards Fe-56 due it is surprisingly high stability.

# 4,a - Why does it release alpha particles
 
 As nuclei become larger and larger, the residual strong nuclear force between the nucleons are overcome by electromagnetic forces[^1] which causes the nucleus to become unstable. To make the nucleus more stable, the atom releases these $\alpha$ particles so that it can shorten the distances between protons in an attempt to become more stable.

# 4,6a - Harms of Ionising Radiation
$\alpha$ decay, $\beta$ decay, and $\gamma$ decay are all forms of ionising radiation, and these can cause large amounts of damage to the human body, however, due o their properties, they all do a different amount of damage, differently, to they human body.

---

$\alpha$ decay is extremely ionising, however, it cannot penetrate most substances and cannot travel far; it does not prove much of a threat outside of the body. However, if it enters the body through cuts, digestion, or breathing, then it can wreck havoc inside your body.

$\beta$ decay is moderately ionising, and it does a better job and penetrating skin, which can cause (beta) burns. However, as with $\alpha$ decay, it is even more dangerous when inside your body.

$\gamma$ decay is only slightly ionising, however, it is dangerous due its ability to completely pierce the human body, as well as some layers of lead and concrete. Gamma decay can also travel relatively far compare to the others, and thus pose the largest threat in nuclear fallouts.

---

Ionising radiation is able to destroy the internal processes of a cell, which can lead to many illnesses, such as vomiting, nausea, and fatigue, as well as an increase in the probability of cancer in later life. If one is subject to a large dosage of radiation is a short time, they may develop **acute radiation syndrome**, which is a more dangerous form of radiation poisoning[^1]. 

# 4,b,a - Neutron's Instability

Free floating neutrons have a half-life of about 15 minutes[^1]. This is because neutrons (up, down, down quarks) are a little heavier than protons (up, up, down quarks), and thus they want to decay down into protons, effectively making them more stable[^2].

Neutron-heavy nuclei are also rather unstable, due the above idea and because as the number of neutrons increase, they begin to occupy higher energy nuclear shells (4,5c - Magic Numbers & Helium Stability, it not only makes itself more stable, but the entire system more stable by dropping down into a nuclear shell that has a lower energy.

# 4,b - Strong Nuclear Force

The strong nuclear force is the strongest of the four fundamental forces in physics. It not only holds the nuclei together, but also the quarks, that make up the protons and neutrons. These quarks are fundamental particles (fermions) that compose hadrons; coming in various different colours and flavours. 

These are bound together by gluons (boson), that are particles that transmit forces; in this case, strong nuclear force, primarily holding quarks together. These gluons are incredibly strong, however, they have a limited range. However, some of this (residual) force happens outside of the nucleons (4,c - Pions.

# 8 - How a Nuclear Reactor Works 
Fuel assemblies (consisting of numerous pellets) are added into the reactor as the fuel, with one pellet containing about the same amount of energy as a tonne of coal. These assemblies were filled with radioactive materials (typically Uranium-235[^1]), and are surrounded by ceramic and metals[^2].  

The nuclear reaction starts as soon as neutrons hits the radioactive substance, causing some of the atoms to undergo fission (a form of cluster decay), which ejects even more neutrons, causing a chain reaction within the reactor.

Nuclear reactions, especially fission, are capable of generating large amounts of heat[^3]. Nuclear reactors and powerplants use this quality to generate electricity, by using this heat to evaporate water in vapour, which spins a turbine[^4], thus generating electricity. However, the nuclear chain reaction used in a nuclear powerplant can quickly get out of hand (see Chernobyl[^5]) and thus, to prevent overheating, water and control rods (made of radiation insulating material) are used. The water plays double duty (maybe triple) here, acting to control the heat in the reactor as well.

# 4,c - Pions

Pions are subatomic particles that consist of one quark (up or down), and one antiquark (up or down). They can be positive, neutral, or negatively charged. Virtual pions transfers the residual strong force between nucleons.[^1]

# 8,a,a - Nuclear Recycling 
It is important to understand that, in a nuclear reactor, uranium-235 is most often used as a main fuel, however, it comes mixed the much more common uranium-238, which is essentially useless. This means that only about 1% of the total possible energy extracted is actually extracted in a nuclear powerplant, with most of it remaining in the uranium-238.

However, it is also this quality that makes nuclear fuel recyclable. If a neutron is added to uranium-238, it becomes uranium-239, which will quickly decay (around 30 minutes) to $\beta$ decay into neptunium-239, which in turn will become plutonium-239, which is another fuel that can be used in conventional nuclear reactors. Thus, nuclear fuel is recyclable.

# 8,a - Nuclear Waste 
Despite what public knowledge may say, nuclear reactor produce very little waste (8,b-Types-of-Nuclear-Waste-and-Storage due to nuclear power’s high energy to fuel ratio[^1], which is effectively contained within containment facilities run by various organisation around the world[^2]. This allows for the safe disposal of nuclear waste, unlike the by-products of fossil fuelled powerplant[^3].

Furthermore, what can be recycled of the depleted radioactive fuels is recycled into more radioactive fuels (8,a,a - Nuclear Recycling, which can continue to be reused within conventional nuclear reactors[^4].

# 8,a,c - Thorium
The use of thorium-232 in nuclear reactors is an interesting proposition that has a lot of potential in the future to replace the standard uranium-235 reactors, and it comes with a variety of advantages, as well as some disadvantages.

Thorium on its own is not a fissile material, and cannot undergo nuclear fission. However, similar to uranium-238, it has the capability of transmuting into fissile element, making thorium-232 fertile. It must first have a neutron added to it, becoming thorium-233, which follows this decay chain: Thorium-233 —$\beta$→ Protactinium-233 —$\beta$→ Uranium-233.

Uranium-232 is another isotope of uranium that can undergo nuclear fission chains. Sadly, conventional reactors cannot use this thorium-uranium cycle, only the uranium-plutonium cycle, however, there exists massive thorium reserves in India, and thus they are likely going to be the country leading thorium-reactor development.

!../../assets/Thorium Reserves.png

Thorium is considered superior to uranium due to a variety of reasons. Firstly, there is more thorium that there is uranium on Earth (approximately 3 times more). Secondly, it does not produce any heavier elements unlike the uranium-plutonium cycle, meaning that the waste from thorium reactors will last considerably shorter than the waste of uranium reactors. Thirdly, it largely mitigates the ability to use it to create a bomb, as it itself is not fissile, and only the uranium-232 produced by it is.

However, the most interesting prospect for thorium is its possible usage in thorium breeder reactors, as thorium are perfectly suited for breeding. Thorium can use slow reactors, as much more neutrons are produced per fission reaction. The utilisation of thorium may encourage the development of breeder reactors, which will reduce the amount of nuclear waste that we produce.

# 8,a,b - Breeder Reactors 
Breeder reactors are special nuclear reactors that can produce more fissile material than is put into the system. They can be likened to a standard nuclear reactor that has an inbuilt recycling system. Breeder reactors allow infertile material to become fertile, by hitting it with a neutron, making them unstable, which allows these reactors to utilise more of the energy in nuclear fuel; this makes them more efficient, but not quite renewable.

The reason that conventional reactors (using uranium-235) cannot do this is because the neutrons do not fly at a fast enough speed to transform uranium-238 to uranium-239. Thus, for breeder reactors that use uranium, they need to be fast reactors, meaning that the neutrons fly at a much higher speed than in a normal reactor.

However, this is still experimental technology, as it has not been developed due to fear that it would make nuclear weapons more accessible, as it will make the radioactive uranium-235 much more abundant.

# 8,c - Repositories 
By far the best way of disposing nuclear waste, both in the present and in the future, would be to store it deep underground until it decays enough to not be radioactive. These facilities are known as repositories, and are currently being used to store nuclear waste. 

Several countries already have these repositories, while others are still undergoing the construction of them. Currently, large repositories are being built in both Sweden and Finland. Despite how undesirable these storage systems may seem, they are relatively safe, and there are no other great alternatives (yet) to storing nuclear waste.

For liquid nuclear waste, it is more difficult to store permanently in these repositories, as all the containers we are capable of building with eventually break during the thousands of years that these materials need to decay. As a result, liquid nuclear waste is currently vitrified into glass, however, there is uncertainty to how long nuclear glass can remain.

# 8,b - Types of Nuclear Waste and Storage
Nuclear waste is split up into three categories: low-level, intermediate-level, and high-level waste. Low-level waste is by far the most common form of nuclear waste, accounting for approximately 90% of the total volume of nuclear waste. This includes items that have been lightly contaminated by radiation, such as the tools that are used in a nuclear reactor. Low-level waste is relatively easy to dispose of, being compacted and stored in short-term storage, then disposed of as regular waste.

!../../assets/Nuclear Waste.png

Intermediate and high-level wastes are more dangerous and difficult to store, however, they are recyclable in most cases[^1], which is employed by most countries. However, select countries have opted to store them in nuclear waste facilities (named repositories)[^2], such as Finland.
