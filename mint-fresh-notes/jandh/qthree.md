It is also often called not a Gothic text, as it does not show much of the generic conventions, and it is more involved with the 'mystery', but more so on the question of the duality of humanity. Despite this, it does show some conventions.
- The weather is not great : This could tie into the industrialisation and the pollution caused by it that occurred during the Victorian age. However, it could also be used as a dramatic feature as well as pathetic fallacy as it reflects the obscurity and the mystery of Jekyll and Hyde, and  the mist only dissipates once the mystery solved.
