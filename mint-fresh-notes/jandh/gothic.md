- Gothic literature often takes place in strange, sometimes suspicious places, such as prisons, castles. It tends to be violet and dangerous, and sometimes sexually stimulating (what the hell).
- Conflict between time periods, such as the medieval and the Renaissance or sometimes even wildly different time periods, such as the ancient and the modern, and yet these two times are blended in order to create a cohesive setting.
    - When the past intrudes onto the present, the present gets disturbed. What should have been left completely and forgotten is now back. What to do now? A similar reasoning applies to ghosts.
    - Gothic literature is equally the present and the past.
- Gothic literature is about power. Power over individuals and the powers over others. Those with powers are strong, those without it are weak. Everything is a pursuit of power. Within Gothic literature, these power structures change and restructure in order to create tension.
- In the same vein, Gothic literature emphasises the difference between the sexes, and it is able to explore the breaking and restructuring of the sexual norms in order to create terror.
- Radcliffe's difference between Terror and Horror
- Gothic literature is full of doubt. Coming out of a time of waning spirituality and a great number of rapid changes, people were skeptical of both the old religions and also of the new sciences. Which could be trusted. The supernatural was looked at with a little bit of skepticism. However, this doubt was often mixed in with uncertainty; at times, the supernatural was never supernatural to begin with, and at other times, it was truly the work of some higher force.
