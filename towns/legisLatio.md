'Legis latio' is a Latin term, meaning the proposing a law. It is what the word 'legislation' is derived from. The reason I bring this up is because I fear that the town is going to become a legislative and administrative monster, which is not a town I want to be a part of.

Much like Franz Kafka, I am ~~very high and wrote a book about a cockroach~~ not the most pleased at bureaucracy, and so I wish that the town does not become one, so here's my plea:

I truly believe that the Town is a wonderful creation, what other project would have brought people like Loren, Shan-mei, Edward, and I together. Half of us barely talk to each other, some of us aren't even close. But the people in the town are talking. It's a miracle that something like this even occurred, but I don't believe it is the idea of the town that brought people together. Sure, the idea of public notes is great and all, but it doesn't appeal to everyone, and maintaining a website is not particularly 'easy' work, it requires some effort to set up.

Neither was it the organisation that allowed us to get stuff done that made people join... because there is no such organisation. We don't get stuff done together. It is a rag-tag group of individuals that for some reason, decided to start sharing their notes. The only cohesion between us are the bonds with each other.

Instead I think it was the community that we somehow ended up creating that drew people in. What other project would have united us like this? I don't think there is anything special about what the town is. It's been done before, in the form of the Notes Coalition, a short-lasting union between Ed, Harper, Mace, notmario, and I. That coalition no longer exists, because there was nothing much that actually unified us.

If you asked me today: "Would you leave the town?", my answer would be no. Why would I want to leave the town? But if you asked me "why?", then my response wouldn't be "Because all of us have this shared ideal of public notes." It would because I would be afraid on what I would miss out on if I were to leave. I would no longer be part of 'the ingroup', and I would not know what my new found friends would be doing.

I made and joined the town because I wanted a system in which we shared notes. I had planned to call it 'The Construct', a massive administrative system in which people submit notes. A cold unfeeling system. Instead, what we got was the Town, a lively group of people who wanted to share notes, and eventually other people who, although weren't particularly invested in making public notes, but who wanted to be part of it anyways. I joined for the notes, but I stayed for the friends I made. For the community that I wanted to be a part of, and one that I wanted to foster.

I fear that the future legislation may turn the town into an unfeeling, complex, and backwards system. One for notes and progress, sure but not one that I will look back on and be proud of, because I am most proud of the town for being able to bring all of these different people with different ideas, all into one place, and that we created a warming environment that allowed people to share ideas and worldviews. How we were able to play Among Us and the likes.

I am afraid that we will get a 'Construct', and not a town. 

In saying, that, I don't believe in voiding all legislation. I'm just saying that we should inject a bit of humanity into the town. Let people join, loosen some restrictions, and create a warm environment, because the greatest strength of the town are not the systems that we build to keep each other in check, but it is the people who do it.

And I am sorry that, under my rule, I was unable to see what made the town so great, and that I was unable to do these things. But I wish that you do not rule like me.
