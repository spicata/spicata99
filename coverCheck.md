pranav always goes on about **look, cover, write, check**. i thought he was insane, but then **he got top 1 in 3 courses**. then i read more stuff that **quizzing is the best way to learn**. anki takes too long to make for most of us, so...

*proposal*: just fold our paper in half, write[^1] **word/term/anything on one side**, then write **definition on the other side**, then test. i guess this is possible on computers as well, but it's harder ([paper or programs](paperPrograms.md)).
