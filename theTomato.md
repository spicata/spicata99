the tomato method[^1], also known in spanish as the pomodoro method[^2] is a method of doing work where you give yourself exactly 25 minutes to work. it's something you can [beat the timer](beatTheTimer.md) with. now, the magic of the tomato is that... you have 25 minutes to finish whatever the crap you are doing. it pushes you to work faster. it's also a good measure of time. sometimes things take 1 tomato to finish, other times it takes 2. preferably, don't take more than 2 tomatoes to finish a task.

also it keeps you in check. don't get carried away doing study.
