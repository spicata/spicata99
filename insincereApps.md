dear companies. you can make wonderful apps, im sure. however, it seems you guys have **no personality whatsoever**. first of all, when i go onto your websites, i don't want to see a **hella generic, unoriginal, minimalist home page**, where i have to scroll for 300 metres to get around 12 lines of information about your product. secondly, i want to feel like i am actually **talking to a person**, not some massive corporate entity. it makes me feel like you don't actually care about me, the user, and instead it just feels like you are just trying to make a profit. it feels you are using me, not trying to give me a useful thing.

*proposal*: be human. (don't do a zuckerburg)
