If you chance a visit around all of the Town's pages, you may notice a slight pattern. Specifically, have a look at these people's websites: Edward, Reaper, Thomas, Jonathan, Ajay, Tom, Athu, Joel.

[ugh, guess i'll have to update this when more join]: #

All of their websites and very similar, it would be remiss to deny it. This is because they are all based on the same Hugo template called Quartz.

Before we continue, I would like to address one misconception that I think many — even Edward — has about how Jekyll and Quartz work. At its core, Jekyll is fundamentally different to Quartz. Jekyll is a static site generator, an application that creates (well) a static site. It's counterpart would be Hugo, an SSG programmed in Go. Jekyll is an application of sorts.

Quartz is merely a Hugo template. It, in itself, is not an SSG. It is a template to said SSG. This occurs with Jekyll as well, there are tons of different ones. The reason I built — and I presume for all the other Jekyll users — is because the Jekyll templates do not fit our goal nor our personalities. So we opted to put in some extra work in order to make something that is ours.

[i guess i could add more here, but i'll only do it if people really ask for it]: #

Quartz is a very useful Hugo template coded by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz). The reason it's so popular within the Town is probably because it meshes well with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which is a note-taking app that is widely used in the Town.

However, this brings me to my belief that, at least in the Town, Quartz has become a cookie-cutter solution (I fear that this might happen to Notion as well). Each one has its own flair, sure, but I don't believe the differences are large enough (except in the case of Edward's website) in order to fully justify not calling it this.

The extent of the differences between the pages are mostly just a few colour changes and font changes.

So what? Well, I want to see a more diverse Town, and I hope you guys can deliver.
