if we get a month to finish something, we will finish it in a month. if we get a week, we'll finish it in a week. if we get a day, we'll finish it in a day. we tend to **finish things by deadlines**. 

*proposal*: **set a timer**. you can guesstimate how long it will take, or just stick to the pomodoro. then find something to finish during this time. then **try to finish** it **before the time runs out**. beat the timer.
